      The house smelled like <span class="fillslot">&nbsp;</span> and <span class="fillslot">&nbsp;</span> as the kids
      walk across the <span class="fillslot">&nbsp;</span> hall. The house seems to be empty but still they can't help
      feeling like <span class="fillslot">&nbsp;</span>.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Look! That door is open!" <span class="fillslot">&nbsp;</span> points to a door <span
        class="fillslot">&nbsp;</span>.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Could <span class="fillslot">C's pet</span> could have gone there? Maybe they already returned outside...", <span
        class="fillslot">&nbsp;</span> whispers their voice trembling.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No they definitely are here", says <span class="fillslot">&nbsp;</span> who has reached the open door first. "I
      can
      see their footsteps in the dust. And they are only going one way...", <span class="fillslot">&nbsp;</span> gulps.
    </p>
    <p>
      The others gather next to them and look down narrow stairway that must go in to the basement of the house.
      However,
      all they can see in the end of the stairs is complete darkness...
    </p>
    <p>
      But then they hear <span class="fillslot">&nbsp;</span> from <span class="fillslot">&nbsp;</span>. They are <span
        class="fillslot">&nbsp;</span>!
